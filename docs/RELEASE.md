# Release

`kinic-vfs-cli` is published as the single operator binary for database setup, scripted writes, archive/restore, and Skill Registry maintenance. The Browser remains the primary public UI.

Primary distribution is GitHub Release assets with SHA-256 checksums. Homebrew is the macOS install path. Cargo install is a Rust-user fallback; crates.io publication is deferred.

## Local Build

```bash
cargo build -p kinic-vfs-cli --bin kinic-vfs-cli --release
target/release/kinic-vfs-cli --help
```

Use the binary with the same flags documented in [`CLI.md`](CLI.md):

```bash
target/release/kinic-vfs-cli --canister-id <canister-id> database current
```

## GitHub Release

Tag a release with a `v*` version:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The `Release CLI` workflow builds and uploads:

- `kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
- `kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-linux-x86_64.sha256`
- `kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
- `kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.sha256`

Each tarball contains only:

- `kinic-vfs-cli`
- `README.md`
- `LICENSE`

Verify after download:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.sha256
tar -xzf kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz
./kinic-vfs-cli --help
```

## Homebrew

The standard tap is `ICME-Lab/homebrew-tap`. If the tap does not exist yet, create it first.

After a GitHub Release is available:

1. Read the release checksum:

   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 kinic-vfs-cli-v0.1.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz
   ```

2. Copy [`../packaging/homebrew/Formula/kinic-vfs-cli.rb`](../packaging/homebrew/Formula/kinic-vfs-cli.rb) into `ICME-Lab/homebrew-tap`.

3. Replace the placeholder `sha256` with the release checksum.

4. Validate inside the tap repo:

   ```bash
   brew audit --strict --online kinic-vfs-cli
   brew install ICME-Lab/tap/kinic-vfs-cli
   brew test kinic-vfs-cli
   ```

Before release assets exist, only local syntax and style checks are expected to pass:

```bash
ruby -c packaging/homebrew/Formula/kinic-vfs-cli.rb
brew style packaging/homebrew/Formula/kinic-vfs-cli.rb
```

## CI Artifacts

The normal `cli-artifacts` CI job uses the same tarball layout as the release workflow, but uploads workflow artifacts instead of creating a GitHub Release.

No `wiki-cli` or `skill-cli` artifact is produced in v1.

## Cargo Fallback

Rust users can install from GitHub when they accept a local Cargo build:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/ICME-Lab/kinic-wiki.git --package kinic-vfs-cli --bin kinic-vfs-cli --locked
kinic-vfs-cli --help
```

crates.io publication is deferred. If needed later, publish in this order:

```text
kinic-vfs-types
kinic-vfs-client
kinic-wiki-domain
kinic-vfs-cli-core
kinic-vfs-cli
```

## Limits

- Artifacts include SHA-256 checksums.
- Artifacts are not signed in v1.
- macOS artifacts are not notarized in v1.
- npm and crates.io publication are deferred.
- Browser deployments are built separately from `wikibrowser/`.
