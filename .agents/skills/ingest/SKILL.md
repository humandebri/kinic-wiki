description: Ingest raw source material into the llm-wiki workflow. Use when turning local files, folders, notes, or normalized source material into review-ready wiki updates under the current canister-backed model.

# Ingest

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- ingest local markdown, notes, docs, or folders into the wiki
- normalize raw source material before wiki synthesis
- persist selected source material under `/Sources/raw/...`
- update existing wiki pages from new evidence
- create review-ready wiki pages without pushing immediately

Do not use this skill for:

- ad hoc question answering without source intake
- health-only review of an existing wiki
- hidden publish or push workflows

Core rules:

- Treat the canister wiki as the source of truth.
- Stop at review-ready unless the user explicitly asks for push.
- Keep source persistence separate from wiki synthesis.
- `log.md` updates are optional.
- PDF handling stays inside ingest as source normalization.

Read [ingest.md](ingest.md) before doing substantive ingest work.
