# Kinic Wiki Ingest

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- ingest local markdown, notes, docs, or folders into the wiki
- normalize raw source material before wiki synthesis
- persist selected source material under `/Sources/raw/...`
- update existing wiki pages from new evidence
- create review-ready wiki pages without pushing immediately

Do not use this skill for:

- ad hoc question answering without source intake
- health-only review of an existing wiki
- hidden publish or push workflows

Core rules:

- Treat the canister wiki as the source of truth.
- Stop at review-ready unless the user explicitly asks for push. `review-ready` means edits and `log.md` updates are complete, but no push or publish step has run.
- Keep source persistence separate from wiki synthesis.
- Read current canonical notes before editing them.
- Preserve settled exact fact spans in `facts.md` instead of paraphrasing or normalizing them away.
- Do not rewrite exact values such as dates, money, fractions, spellings, product names, or role labels when a settled source span already exists.
- `facts.md` is not a transcript dump. Exclude gratitude, acknowledgements, question phrasing, tentative future plans, scheduled meetings, deadlines, and dated event lines unless they are being routed to their canonical note.
- When pages are created, deleted, or edited, update `log.md`.
- Keep `log.md` append-only and easy to inspect with `tail -n 5`.
- PDF handling stays inside kinic-wiki-ingest as source normalization.
- Treat `WIKI_CANONICALITY.md` as the schema authority.
